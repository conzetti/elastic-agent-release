* Gather the _latest_ Elastic Agent from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elastic-agent

* Add the updated agent to the BOSH blob store
  ```console
  bosh add-blob ~/Downloads/elastic-agent-8.10.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz elastic-agent-8.10.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
  ```

* Optionally upload the blobs to S3 (not required for offline or local development)
```console
bosh upload-blobs
```

* Amend the following files with the updated agent filename
  ```
  packages/elastic-agent/spec
  ```

* Generate a release tarball
  ```bash
  bosh create-release \
    --name elastic-agent-release \
    --version 0.0.1-alpha \
    --tarball /tmp/release.tgz \
    --[force | final]
  ```
* **NOTE**: When crafting your `runtime.yml`, be sure to reference the updated release version (_and_ make sure that you've uploaded the new release to BOSH)
